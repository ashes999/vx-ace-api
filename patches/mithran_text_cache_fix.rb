%Q(
This script is a workaround for the Bitmap#draw_text issues in RPGMaker VX Ace.
 
By default, there are several errors with Bitmap#draw_text in Ace.
 
1.  Text shrinking algorithm is overzealous.  Text drawn to a rect given by
    its own text_size is reduced in size.  This is both counterintuitive, and not
    the way it worked in previous versions (VX).
 
2.  Text drawn to any rect wider than approx 640 pixels wraps around to the
    beginning of the line, overwriting previous text.  This also causes center
    and right alignments to fail.  This is both unnecessary and not how it worked
    in VX.
   
3.  Text drawn character by character with non true-type fonts has awkward spacing.
    In addition, the text_size of a string of characters is not the same as the
    sum of the text_size of each character.
    This existed even in VX.
   
4.  The first character of a Bitmap#draw_text command for certain letters on
    certain fonts is not drawn correctly.  Since message window draws character
    by character, this can become a major issue. (example: Verdana 20 pt font)
   
These errors can be demonstrated using my text draw debugger:

What this script does:
 
1.  Adds 2 pixels to any draw_text width, so text can be intuitively drawn to its
    own text_size rect. Offsets x coordinate where appropriate.
    If SIMPLE_FIX is set to true, only this fix will be enabled.
   
2.  Adds a text cache.  Instead of drawing text directly when called, a unique
    bitmap is created for any potential text draw with buffers, drawn with extra
    space around it.  The character is then copied whenever a text draw is
    attempted.
   
    Text Caching can be turned off by setting SIMPLE_FIX to true.
   
    Text Caching also has the following features:
    - Much faster processing than the original Bitmap#draw_text.
      Trades a small amount of memory to accomodate faster processing speed.
      The first time any letter is drawn takes approximately 3-4 times as long,
      subsquently, any time this same letter and font is drawn it is upwards of
      twice as fast.  The longer the string drawn, the bigger the difference.
    - Accounts for a 3-length string when checking the size.  This makes single
      characters drawn look more natural for the offending fonts.
    Does not work with:
    - Reduced size text.
      If text is squeezed due to not being given enough room to draw, text caching
      is bypassed in favor of the original method.  This is due to the text
      squeezing algorithm reducing each character by a variable amount that can
      not be determined with text_size.  Manually stretching or aligning this
      "squeezed" text looks completely awful, so for now, this will have to
      stay like this.
      The exception to this is if the text has "just enough" room to draw,
      it will be given the two extra pixels rather than squeezing it.
    - If text extends beyond MAX_DRAW_WIDTH, text caching will be forced.
      This disables the "squeeze" effect.  Using the default method means the text
      would draw over itself anyway, so this is the lesser of two evils.
     
Changelog:
 
v 1.03
  Added an option to control how much buffer is given before text squeeze turns off.
  Added an absolute width limit allowed for a draw_text operation to prevent a rare game.exe crash.
  Added an option to completely disable the default squeezing method to always cache.
 
v 1.02
  Fixed crash error when drawing a null/zero height character.
 
v 1.01
  Fixed crash error when using F12 to reset. (Thanks Archiea_Nessiah)
 
v 1.0
Official release.
